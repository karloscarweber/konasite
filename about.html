    <h1>What and _why?</h1>
    <p class="headliner">KonaScript (or Kona) is small, fast language meant to replace JavaScript on the web. </p>
    <p>I started work on this language a few weeks ago on a whim because I had this really strong feeling that I wanted CoffeeScript to have a come back but I just didn't like the syntax. A silly thing to think, I know. Well, to change that I would need to learn how an interpreter works, so I started learning how interpreters work. One thing, led to another, and now I'm full swing in developing a new language for the web. <strong>KonaScript</strong>.</p>
    <p>Kona takes inspiration from languages like <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>CoffeeScript</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>Swift</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>Lua</strong>. <strong>Kona</strong> is iteratively typed, You can <i>"type hint"</i> function parameters and the language will check the types of only the parameters that are hinted. Kona is object oriented, every value either is an object, or has an associated behaviour table so that you can interact with it like it's in a object. Functions are first class citizens in <strong>Kona</strong>, but because of the object oriented nature of the language, getting a reference to a function value means grabbing it's <i>handle</i>. </p>

    <p>Kona is meant for the web HTML, CSS, and JSON are first class citizens. Special literals are made for each, so that you can interleave Kona along with your HTML, CSS, and JSON. Kona offers a simplified templating language similar to mustache.</p>

    <p>Kona is written in <strong>C</strong> and <strong>Lua</strong>, running on a <strong>LuaJIT</strong> core, in a modified Lua environment. <strong>Kona</strong> is compiled to Lua, then transformed into Lua bytecode. This makes Kona very fast, easy to modify, and easy to develop, while still being very small.</p>

    <p>The design goals of <strong>Kona</strong> are to replace <strong>JavaScript</strong> on the web for medium to large applications; To provide a stable and long lived VM target, and to <i>make difficult</i> much of the issues faced by JavaScript and the Javascript ecosystem, namely weak type checking, convoluted namespacing, dependency hell, <i>etc...</i>. </p>

    <p>Kona offers simple and extensible meta programming features.</p>

    <p>But all of that is still yet a dream. Kona is under active development.</p>
