    <p>For now it's just me, Karl Oscar Weber the first, working on this thing like a lone gunman riding from town to town. A man with no name, no purpose, haunted by the mistakes of my past, and the vacancy of promise in my future. </p>

    <p>Email me at <a href="mailto:me@kow.fm">me@kow.fm</a>, if you're interested in working on Kona.</p>

    <p>Open an Issue on <a href="https://github.com/karloscarweber/kona">Github</a> if you feel like this thing needs a fixin'.</p>
